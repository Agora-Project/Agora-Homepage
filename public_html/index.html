        <div id="section" > Welcome to the Agora Project! The goal of this project 
            is to create the software for a flexible graph-based forum for discussion 
            and debate. It will support reconfiguration to many purposes through 
            a client-interpreted, server-checked protocol. In its final implementation, 
            each node and edge in the database could be configured to hold arbitrary 
            data accepted or denied for inclusion by the server, with the client 
            determining (or not, and ignoring) the data's representation based on 
            its own knowledge of formats that exist. Additionally, references and 
            branching to multiple servers will be supported by both server-server 
            and server-client-server routing, similar to DNS.
            <p>
            Initially and as a test-bed for this functionality, the project will 
            develop towards an implementation of a working online debate system. 
            Later, support for unregulated and undirected discussion will be investigated 
            and included in the client/server toolkit we develop.
